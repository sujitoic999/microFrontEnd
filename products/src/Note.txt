1. when we're loading our code to browser
we don't want to load multiple files but we
want to laod minimum number of files.
The role of webpack is, if we have multiple
javascript files with various dependencies or single 
dependency it will combine them to single 
output file. which bydefault name would be 
main.js in dist folder. this main.js file is 
output of webpack directory. sometimes it will also named as 
bundle.js

2. When we run "npm init" package.json file
created but when we install dependencies
then package.lock.json file and node module use to be created 

3. "scripts": {
  "start": "webpack serve"
}

When you run npm start, this script executes webpack serve, 
which starts your Webpack development server
to serve your project files for development purposes.

"webpack serve": This command tells Webpack to start its 
development server, known as webpack-dev-server. 
It sets up a local server that serves your application,
watches for changes in your files, and automatically reloads
the browser when changes are detected.
